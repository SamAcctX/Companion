Your message was removed because it contained only numbers, making you vulnerable to a deceptive "age attack" on Discord. This occurs when **User A** asks a seemingly innocent question like, "How many sides does an octagon have?" After **User B** responds with "8," **User A** later edits the question to something more malicious, such as "How old are you?" This manipulation creates the false impression that **User B** has claimed to be 8 years old, which can then be reported to Discord as a violation of age policy. Given the platform's strict rules, this could lead to **User B** facing a permanent ban despite their innocence. While we understand this is frustrating, being wrongfully banned is far worse. Thank you for your understanding.
